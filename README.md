Dear Sir or Madam:

I was immediately interested when I came across the “_______” position at _______. I have been looking for interesting job opportunities and found this position appealing on many different levels. While I have loved working at Moore College of Art & Design, I have been looking to further advance my career focusing on technology project management, social media and web management. 

I have an extensive background in project management focusing on web technologies, databases, social media campaign planning, web content, and information management, which I feel makes me an ideal candidate for this position. 

My current role at Moore is very diverse and demonstrates my adaptability to change and learn new skills. I started out in 2006 in the Development Department working primarily on fund raising, event coordination, and managing our database. My role expanded over time and to also include Website Management and Social Media. I enjoy wearing many hats in my position and work best under pressure and when challenged by new situations and strive to bring new ideas to the table.

Working at _________ would be the great opportunity for me to use my knowledge and apply skills in this field. I have attached my resume for your review, and would love to talk to your more about this position. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
